The president of our tenant association is seemingly trying to hold onto power and has written a proposal she keeps claiming is funded by HUD when its not ignores the Brown Act, Sunshine Act, Voters Rights, among other things.

I found out from another agency who is investigating the president on other matters notified me of a pending lawsuit, which I have yet to be served on.

I also found out our TA pres invited Yvette Corkrean to speak to our tenants looking to repeal Prop 19 & Scott Wiener. Prop 19 is Wild Firefighting Money
