        <h2>My Thoughts After Reading <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf" target="_new">the RCA Proposal</a>
        </h2>
        <!-- h3>At the Request of Margo McNulty, </h3-->
        <h3 class="bottom">Reviewed by Angel Rittenburg</h3>
        <p class="disclaimer">
          <strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>In 2023, Margo handed me her "Residents Council of Advisors" proposal. She asked me if I could "look it over and hopefully support" her proposal. Until May 15, 2024, Margo and I had a very friendly and what I thought professional relationship. When she asked if I would look at her work. Not knowing what her proposal was about, I agreed to read it and get back to her if I had any questions. After reading it, I did have many concerns about the proposal and asked many times if we could talk about it. Margo never took the time to answer my concerns, and chose to add what she thinks is my name as a supporter, and has since ignored my repeated requests for her to remove my name as a supporter. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Because Margo has [allegedly] presented this proposal to many government agencies - including the Homeless Oversight Committee and other HUD/RAD Tenant Associations</strong> - I felt it necessary to ensure my position regarding the RCA Proposal as presented by Margo McNulty be clarified, the goals of the RCA Board be shared publicly, and above all <mark>I need to ensure that the public knows why I personally do not endorse the RCA plan.</mark>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Make your own choice whether to support Margo's RCA proposal,</strong> but make sure you know what the plan</p>
        <h4>
          <span class="IMHO">In my opinion,</span> all government agencies are open to new ideas on how to fulfill the work of the government.
        </h4>
        <p>Just look around. The Supreme Court all the way to county administrators are being targeted by people unwilling to accept the Rule of Law. Regardless of <span class="IMHO">your opinions</span> on what is just or not, there are two ways to resolve problems - the easy & softer way or the hard & contencioius way. </p>
        <p><span class="IMHO">My opinion is formed from my experience</span> as a former Business Manager, former Tribal Operations Secretary at <a href="https://www.lyttonrancheria.com/" target="_new">Lytton Rancheria</a>, former Contract Administrator for the <a href="http://www.oakha.org/residents/public_housing/pages/default.aspx" target="_new">Oakland Housing Authority</a>, former Secretary for <a href="http://www.genesisca.org" target="_new">Genesis in Oakland</a>, former Secretary, Minister, and Committee Member at <a href="https://fccolovefirst.org/" target="_new">First Congregational Church of Oakland, CA</a>. I was trained in community organizing by <a href="https://www.gamaliel.org" target="_new">Gamaliel</a>, a faith-based group <a href="https://www.essence.com/celebrity/community-organizers-barack-obama/" target="_new">who trained Barak Obama</a>.</p>

        <div class="well" style="background-color: rgb(148, 238, 194); box-shadow: 0 0 4px;">
          <p>I am always open to hear ideas from other people but, I will not blindly endorse a plan from anyone without reviewing and evaluating to form <span class="IMHO">my own opinion</span>. </p>
          <p>A few times, Margo asked if I would support her plan. I told her before I could, I had questions. Unfortunately, we never had an opportunity to discuss those questions, so I am left with providing <span class="IMHO">my opinion</span> on <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf">the version of her RCA Proposal she said she was presenting to the City of San Francisco</a>. </p>
        </div>
        <p><span class="IMHO">In my opinion,</span>&nbsp;the <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf" target="_new">RCA Proposal</a> is a narrative in need of an action plan that identifies some of HUD's problems and the Agency's need for modernization, but RCA in its current form does not appear to be a well-planned and plotted implementation plan for creating a privately funded layer of oversight to an exisiting multi-jurisdiction agency tasked with providing independent financial oversight and proper elections, as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-24/subtitle-B/chapter-IX/part-964?toc=1" target="_new">the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964</a>.
        <p>The RCA Proposal lacks any citations, references, or even andecdotal accounts to support their claims alledged against CCSD.</p></p>
        <p><span class="IMHO">I think</span> the <a href="imgz1760/RCAmm/RCA-no-link.pdf" target="_new">RCA Proposal</a><strong>would need to address several topics, including:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clarify the Objective and Scope:</strong><br />&nbsp;- Define the specific goals of replacing the agency.</strong><br />&nbsp;- Outline the scope of the changes and the jurisdictions involved.
          <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 Part 964.</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Identify and address any legal and regulatory requirements for financial oversight and election procedures.</li>
          <li><strong>Governance Structure:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Develop a new governance structure that ensures independent financial oversight.</strong></li>
            <br />&nbsp;- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for overseeing proper elections.</li>
          <li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Engage with stakeholders, including residents, local authorities, and federal agencies, to gather input and build support.
            <br />&nbsp;- Establish communication channels to keep stakeholders informed throughout the implementation process.</li>
          <li><strong>Transition Plan:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Develop a detailed transition plan that outlines the steps for phasing out the existing agency and establishing the new oversight body.
            <br />&nbsp;- Include timelines, milestones, and key deliverables.</li>
          <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Identify the resources required for the transition, including personnel, budget, and technology.
            <br />&nbsp;- Develop a budget and allocate resources accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
            <br />&nbsp;- Establish a risk management plan to address any issues that arise during the transition.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong>
            <br />&nbsp;- Develop a plan for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the new oversight body.
            <br />&nbsp;- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> is the Authoring Team's perspective of the root cause of problems with no legitimate sources of data to support any plan facing any issue arising from implementing the HUD/RAD program, and it does not provide a path for or sources of funding, staffing requirements, or a propose a clear path for implementation of a plan should one arise. </p>
        <p>Additionally, the <strong>RCA Proposal</strong> does not specify the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A legitimate source for the "Training Materials" to be implemented</li>
          <li>References to any sources, accredited training programs, or recognized experts in the field to support the Objective and Scope, should one arise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="IMHO">I think</span> that for a proposal to be considered legitimate in terms of training materials, it should include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disclosure of funding source</li>
          <li>Credentials for any of the Trainers</li>
          <li>Examples of relevant training material</li>
          <li>References to reputable sources for any claims regarding organizational efficiency or inefficiency</li>
          <li>Listing of issues that this proposal would address</li>
          <li>Referencing existing and proven accredited HUD/RAD Tenant Association training programs, or any recognized experts in the field</li>
        </ul>
